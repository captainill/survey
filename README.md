## Personal Survey using React/Flux

## Running

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.
From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

`webpack -w`

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will
update bundle.js with any changes you wish to make.

After starting the watcher, you can open `index.html` in your browser to
open the app.
